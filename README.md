# The Litle Submarine That Could
The Little Submarine That Could is an old-school single player game where a submarine must navigate through the game in order to reach the treasure chest and win the game. Consisting of three levels, The Little Submarine That Could challenges the player to reach the destination required before losing all health and fuel points. With fuel and health top-ups scattered throughout the game it is a challenge to see the players navigate through the game with skilled accuracy.

Built a long time ago by Andrew Thompson, Maegan Kennedy, Michael Blayney, Amy Wilson and Jannat Khan **as second-year students in 2017.**
